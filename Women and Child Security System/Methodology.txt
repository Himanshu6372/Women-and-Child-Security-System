To program the ESP8266 with the NodeMCU firmware and interface with the Ublox NEO-6M GPS module for transmitting GPS data, you'll need to write firmware code in the Arduino IDE. Below is a basic outline of the programming steps:

1 Install Arduino IDE:
Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website if you haven't already.

2 Install ESP8266 Board Package:
Open Arduino IDE, go to File > Preferences, and enter the following URL in the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field:
http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json 
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search for "esp8266," and install the "esp8266" board package.

3 Install Required Libraries:
Install the necessary libraries for interfacing with the Ublox NEO-6M GPS module. You may need libraries such as TinyGPS++ for parsing GPS data.

4 Write Firmware Code:
Write the firmware code in the Arduino IDE to configure the ESP8266, read GPS data from the Ublox NEO-6M module, and transmit it via Wi-Fi using the Blynk library.
Initialize the serial communication for both the GPS module and Blynk.
Read GPS data from the GPS module using the appropriate library functions.
Transmit GPS data to the Blynk server using Blynk's virtual pins.
Optionally, implement additional features such as error handling, geofencing, or alert notifications.

5 Upload Firmware to ESP8266:
Connect the NodeMCU ESP8266 board to your computer via USB.
Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE (e.g., NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module) and the corresponding port).
Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the firmware code to the ESP8266 board.

6 Monitor Serial Output (Optional):
Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to monitor the serial output for debugging purposes.
Print debug messages or GPS data to the Serial Monitor to verify the functionality of the GPS tracker.

7 Test GPS Tracker:
Once the firmware is uploaded successfully, open the Blynk app on your smartphone and run the Blynk project.
Verify that the GPS data is being transmitted to the Blynk server and displayed correctly on the Blynk app's interface.
By following these programming steps, you can create a GPS tracker using the ESP8266 and interface it with the Ublox NEO-6M GPS module to transmit GPS data via Wi-Fi using the Blynk platform.
